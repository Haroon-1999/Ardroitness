    <string name="van1">Starry Night: Starry Night was painted in 1889 by Vincent Van Gogh while he was at the Saint Paul de Mausole asylum, where he was given the freedom to paint and read. Van Gogh was recovering well until a relapse occurred that sent him back down a dark, suicidal place mentally and, out of this depression, he painted Starry Night.</string>
    <string name="van2">Sunflowers: Sunflowers is part of a series of sunflower paintings done by Van Gogh. These paintings sought to change perspectives on both art and life, and are renowned for their level of detail and perfect expression of the beauty of nature that few have been able to replicate. </string>
    <string name="van3">Potato Eaters: Potato Eaters was completed in 1885 and is today viewed to be Vincent van Gogh’s first great work of art. The goal of this painting was to portray humans existing naturally, and not looking awkward. While Van Gogh’s unrefined technique caused him to miss the mark with his initial goal, the result made the painting more respected by the art community. </string>
    <string name="van4">Worn Out: Worn Out is a drawing done by Van Gogh in the early part of his career (1882). While done for practice, Worn Out captured the exhaustion of the working class, whom Van Gogh had a knack for drawing in a way that showed life.</string>
